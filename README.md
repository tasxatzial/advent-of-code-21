# Advent of code solutions (2021)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015.

The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language. Participants also compete based on speed on both global and private leaderboards.
